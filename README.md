# Robust_system_identification
During my second year of master degree at Politecnico di Torino, I attended a course colled 'Laboratory of robust identification and control'. One of the main argument of this course was the robust identification of a nonlinear Hammerstein system, nonlinear Wiener System, cascade of LTI discrete-time subsystem and discrete-time linear time-invariant system. In this case I will show the robust identification of a nonlinear Hammerstein system and I carried the identification using MATLAB.
In this repository you will find:
- The trace/report "Robust identification.pdf"
- The script "ex_1.m"
- The data "data_exam_2A_hammer_ver2.mat"
